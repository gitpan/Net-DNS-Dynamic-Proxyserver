Net::DNS::Dynamic::Proxyserver - a dynamic DNS proxy,
which lets you run your own nameserver who answers
DNS questions from your /etc/hosts file or your SQL database.

The full documentation with examples is available via:

 perldoc Net::DNS::Dynamic::Proxyserver

A simple example script will be installed in

/usr/local/bin/dns-proxy.pl

which can be used as a basis for your own
DNS proxy server. It does not support answers
from SQL queries at this moment. You need to
write your own wrapper script, if you want
SQL support.

Please run 

 /usr/local/bin/dns-proxy.pl --help

to see a list of available options.
